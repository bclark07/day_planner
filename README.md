# day_planner
Calendar displays work day time blocks. Each block is color coded based on whether it is in the past or future, or current hour. Text can be typed into the time block. Text is saved by hitting a submit button to the right of each hourly block. Colors update based on saving and submitting new entries, or hitting the refresh button. Calendar only displays one day at a time.
